In 2020, the WHO listed COVID-19 as the third leading cause of death, preceded by heart disease and cancer. However, these are categories that encompass many different types of illness such as lung cancer, stroke, and kidney cancer. COVID-19 is the disease caused by the single virus: SARS-CoV-2. It therefore makes sense to compare all causes of death as individual entities, rather than comparing singular causes to entire categories.

Something else to keep in mind is that COVID-19 is [increasing](https://newsroom.heart.org/news/covid-toll-realized-cvd-deaths-take-big-jump-especially-among-certain-populations#:~:text=25%2C%202023%20%E2%80%94%20The%20number%20of,2019%20to%20928%2C741%20in%202020.) the death toll of cardiovascular complications. This is because SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate within the [arterial walls](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-sars-cov-2-contributes-heart-attacks-strokes). This means that a portion of deaths in the heart disease category are actually Covid deaths in disguise.

It is important to be aware of this when reading [the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7218a3.htm#:~:text=During%202022%2C%20the%20three%20leading,218%2C064) announcement that COVID-19 was the fourth leading cause of death in 2022. The relative and absolute toll of this disease still remains higher than it appears due to the illusion created by comparing categories to singular causes of death, and the fact that COVID-19 is increasing the death rate for heart disease and maybe even [cancer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908423001360?fbclid=IwAR2SrX8vKYxZf0_-Ia83L3TEu_1EIbVjJLpTv4Sahn93U5PGmX6i6TCKlbc). Even without these factors, the fourth leading cause of death is nothing to scoff at, especially when it is airborne and highly infectious. Thankfully, the ability to avoid infection is a choice that can be made by individuals and societies.

## Methodology

Base mortality numbers comes from this [2020 CDC mortality report](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db427-tables.pdf#1). The stratified view of heart disease and stroke comes from [this report](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001123#F14-1) from the AHA. The proportion of sub-causes from the stroke category is derived from the global ratio of stroke rates for each cause ([Source - Table 15-1](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001123#R3-24)). The stratified view of cancer comes from [this report](https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/#/AtAGlance/) from the CDC. The stratified view of COVID-19 deaths comes from [this report](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/podcasts/2022/20220107/20220107.htm) from the CDC.
