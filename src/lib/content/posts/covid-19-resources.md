"We found that various parameters of arterial stiffness and central hemodynamics respond simultaneously to the mild COVID-19 disease in predominantly healthy individuals... the worsening of values of those found to be responsive points toward the existence of a widespread and long-lasting pathological process in the vasculature following the infection. The detected responses to COVID-19 disease are not straightforward but rather deteriorate with the time since the onset of COVID-19 infection and age."

The two quotes that best sum up the article: "Early on, we saw it could impact the vascular system in cases of serious illness. But now we appreciate the long-term consequences of infection. Large, follow-up studies are showing that people who have been exposed to COVID have increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications — so, increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and heart rhythm disturbances. It can also lead to blood clots, especially to organs that receive a lot of blood such as the brain, heart and kidney." and "You’d think this would only happen in people who got really sick with COVID, but the severity of the infection doesn’t seem to make a difference. These complications can occur even in people who have very mild symptoms. The big surprise is how much this can affect younger people. Studies are showing that even young, active people can experience heightened risk of these complications." |

Three majors findings: (1) Greater reduction in grey matter thickness and tissue contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus; (2) Areas that are functionally connected to the primary olfactory cortex had greater changes in markers of tissue damage. This explains the common symptom of losing sense of smell during covid infection and attributes it to brain damage; (3) Greater reduction of global brain size in those who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with those participants also showing on average greater cognitive decline between the two imaging time points. These effects were still seen when removing the hospitalized covid patients from the dataset. |

The findings were so strong that the researchers concluded that even children with mild/moderate COVID-19 disease courses should be evaluated for acute kidney injury and subclinical AKI. |

The CDC currently lists covid as the 3rd leading cause of death. This is even worse than it seems because the two causes above it, "heart disease" and "cancer", are categories of disease. Neither are specific/individual diseases, but more of umbrella terms that capture many separate diseases such as strokes, embolisms, infarctions, lung cancer, kidney cancer, etc. Covid is 1 disease and manages to be right up there with categorical collections of multiple diseases. |

Completely neglects long term effects of covid. "[Among working people 35 to 44 years old](https://www.soa.org/49b504/globalassets/assets/files/resources/experience-studies/2022/group-life-covid-19-mortality-12-2022.pdf), a stunning 34% more died than expected in the last quarter of 2022, with above-average rates in other working-age groups, too." Covid has been well described as an endothelial disease, which conrtributes to the increased risk of dying of a heart attack or stroke after acute infection. These are deaths that are attributable to covid because they would not have occured with infection, but this article completely neglects that and goes on wondering what could be the cause of this "unnatural loss of life" on a global scale since 2020. |
