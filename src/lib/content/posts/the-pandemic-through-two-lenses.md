Following the science is a statement that makes many envision turmoil, constant flip-flopping of what is and isn't true, and general societal chaos. The term has been weaponized by individuals and organizations across public health, governments, and corporations to justify personal means, often without considering what current scientific knowledge dictates. Throughout the pandemic, this has resulted in the public associating scientists and science as a concept with these disjointed, haphazard views that unpredictably destabilize economies and societies.

Below, we present a timeline of the pandemic that presents what scientists were *actually* saying versus what mainstream media and politicians were saying and often attributing to/misinterpreting scientists.
